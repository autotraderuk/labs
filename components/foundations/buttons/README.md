## Primary Button

Used to denote a critical action that is considered the main action for the user. 
A main action can be defined by two possibilities:

1. The route that helps to guide the user through their task. 
2. The route that we wish to convert the user through.   

â€¨There should only ever be one Primary button on a given page. 
Where there are multiple possible critical routes, the route that the majority of users are expected to go down takes precendent & other routes should use Secondary buttons.
