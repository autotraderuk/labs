title: AutoTrader Core Experience
---

Core is a shared design and development for the whole of AutoTrader. In practice, this means that designers and developers collaborate to establish design patterns and elements that are used throughout AT products to enable greater consistency and speed of development.

Each product or tech stack may have their own Component Library which would act both as an implementation of Core but elaborate on it with the needs of a specific instance and the JavaScript behaviours that component would need. In this way, a Component is using a Design Pattern from Core and making it work for the requirements of the product.
